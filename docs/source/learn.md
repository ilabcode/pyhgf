# Learn

In this section, you can find tutorial notebooks that describe the internals of pyhgf, the theory behind the Hierarchical Gaussian filter, and step-by-step application and use cases of the model. At the beginning of every tutorial, you will find a badge [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ilabcode/pyhgf/blob/master/docs/source/notebooks/0.1-Creating_networks.ipynb) to run the notebook interactively in a Google Colab session.
